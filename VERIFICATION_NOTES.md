# Verification Notes

## Testing Plan

### 1. Network Request Verification
**Before Refactor:**
- Multiple GET requests on app mount
- Request storms during navigation
- Duplicate subscriptions

**After Refactor:**
- Exactly 1 GET request per resource on cold start
- No additional GET requests during navigation
- Stable subscription behavior

### 2. Console Logging
Added temporary logging to verify:
- Subscription status (should show "SUBSCRIBED" only once per resource)
- Fetch calls (should show limited fetches)
- Realtime events (should process without errors)

### 3. API Gateway Monitoring
Monitor:
- Request count stabilization
- No spike patterns
- Consistent CRUD + Realtime only traffic

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Cold Start
1. Close app completely
2. Reopen app
3. Monitor network tab
4. Expected: 1 GET /todos, 1 GET /transactions
5. Expected: SUBSCRIBED messages appear once each

### Scenario 2: Tab Navigation
1. Navigate between dashboard, todos, transactions
2. Pull to refresh on each screen
3. Expected: No additional GET requests
4. Expected: Realtime updates apply without fetches

### Scenario 3: Realtime Updates
1. Add/update/delete item from another client
2. Monitor first client
3. Expected: Realtime event processed
4. Expected: No GET request triggered

### Scenario 4: Focus Events
1. Switch away from app and back
2. Expected: No refetch storms
3. Expected: Stable subscription state

## Expected Console Output

### On Successful Cold Start:
```
[Supabase Debug] Supabase client initialized successfully
[Network #1] Fetching todos { userId: "..." }
[Network #2] Fetching transactions { userId: "..." }
[Subscription #1] Channel status: SUBSCRIBED
[Subscription #2] Channel status: SUBSCRIBED
```

### During Navigation:
```
// No additional network logs expected
// Only CRUD or Realtime events
```

### During Realtime Updates:
```
[Subscription #3] Realtime event: INSERT item-id-123
[Subscription #4] Realtime event: UPDATE item-id-456
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Temporary Logging:** Development logging should be removed in production
2. **DataContext:** The DataContext.tsx file still contains the old implementation pattern and should be refactored separately
3. **Filtering:** Complex filtering logic was moved from hooks to components for simplicity

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered:
1. Revert hook files to previous versions
2. Restore dashboard screen to previous version
3. Remove throttling if causing delays
4. Re-add complex filtering if needed

## Performance Metrics

### Target Metrics:
- Cold start: â‰¤ 2 network requests
- Navigation: 0 network requests
- Realtime processing: < 100ms per event
- Memory usage: Stable after initial load

### Monitoring Points:
- Network tab in dev tools
- Console logs for subscription status
- API Gateway request count
- Memory profiling
