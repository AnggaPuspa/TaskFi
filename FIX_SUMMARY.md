# Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Excessive API Requests**: Multiple sources of data fetching causing hundreds of requests per hour
2. **Hooks Violations**: Dashboard screen had conditional hook calls violating React Rules of Hooks
3. **Duplicate Subscriptions**: DataContext and individual hooks both creating realtime subscriptions
4. **Inefficient State Management**: Complex optimistic update logic duplicated across components

## Changes Made

### 1. Refactored Core Hooks (`src/hooks/useTodos.ts` and `src/hooks/useTransactions.ts`)

- **Optimistic Updates**: Implemented proper optimistic UI with immediate updates and rollback on error
- **Realtime Integration**: Added proper Supabase realtime subscriptions with user filtering
- **Instrumentation**: Added development logging for network requests and subscriptions
- **Enabled Flags**: Proper handling of enabled/disabled states to prevent unnecessary fetches
- **Dependency Optimization**: Fixed useEffect dependencies to prevent infinite loops

### 2. Fixed Dashboard Screen (`app/(app)/(tabs)/dashboard.tsx`)

- **Rules of Hooks Compliance**: All hooks now called at top level in stable order
- **Early Return Pattern**: Moved conditional rendering after all hooks
- **Proper Hook Usage**: Using new optimized hooks instead of old DataContext
- **Correct Refetch Implementation**: Proper pull-to-refresh with Promise.all

### 3. Simplified DataContext (`src/context/DataContext.tsx`)

- **Removed Duplicate Logic**: Eliminated data fetching and realtime subscriptions
- **Focused Responsibility**: Now only handles global state clearing and connection testing
- **Reduced Complexity**: Removed complex reducer and state management

### 4. Enhanced Realtime Helper (`src/utils/applyChange.ts`)

- **Duplicate Prevention**: Added checks to prevent duplicate items in realtime updates
- **Instrumentation**: Added logging for realtime events
- **Statistics**: Added helper functions to get event statistics

### 5. Supabase Client Instrumentation (`utils/supabase.ts`)

- **Network Logging**: Added request counting and logging
- **Method Wrapping**: Wrapped Supabase methods with logging
- **Statistics**: Added helper to get request statistics

### 6. Realtime Setup Instructions (`supabase/realtime-setup.sql`)

- **Publication Commands**: Added SQL to properly enable realtime for tables
- **Verification Queries**: Added queries to check publication and RLS setup

## Results

1. **Reduced Network Requests**: From hundreds per hour to just initial fetch + realtime events
2. **Stable Hooks**: No more "change in order of Hooks" warnings
3. **Instant UI Updates**: Optimistic updates provide immediate feedback
4. **Proper Realtime Sync**: Single subscription per table with proper cleanup
5. **Better Error Handling**: Consistent error handling with rollback on failures
6. **Development Visibility**: Instrumentation to monitor request counts and performance

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ No "change in order of Hooks" warnings anywhere
✅ Delete/Add/Edit immediately visible (optimistic) and consistent after realtime
✅ Subscription SUBSCRIBED without error; cleanup on unmount; no duplicate channels
✅ API Gateway shows significant hit reduction (no hundreds GET/hour from one screen)
✅ All CRUD functions return results/err consistently & typed
✅ No need to restart Metro/Expo
